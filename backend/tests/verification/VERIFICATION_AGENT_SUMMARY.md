## 📊 Reporting Capabilities

### Real-time Console Output
```
🔍 Starting Port Management Tests...
✅ Database Synchronization: Port manager successfully synchronized
✅ Port Allocation/Release: Working correctly
❌ Port Conflict Prevention: Issues detected
...
```

### Generated Reports
1. **JSON Report** - Structured data for automated processing
2. **HTML Report** - Interactive web-based dashboard
3. **Console Report** - Plain text for logs and CI/CD
4. **Summary Report** - High-level overview with recommendations

### Exit Codes
- `0` - All tests passed
- `1` - One or more tests failed

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all verification tests
npm run verify

# Run individual test suites
npm run verify:port      # Port management only
npm run verify:cleanup   # Cleanup tests only
npm run verify:duplicates # Duplicate service tests only

# Validate agent structure
node tests/verification/test-runner-validation.js
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
- name: Verify MCP Backend
  run: npm run verify
- name: Upload verification reports
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: verification-reports
    path: reports/verification/
```

## 🔍 What Gets Verified

### Port Management Fixes
- ✅ Port manager properly syncs with database on initialization
- ✅ Ports are allocated and released correctly
- ✅ Port conflicts are prevented
- ✅ Proper port cleanup on process termination
- ✅ No port leaks occur

### Cleanup Fixes
- ✅ Process termination releases ports properly
- ✅ Database cleanup on instance deletion works
- ✅ Graceful vs forced termination cleanup
- ✅ No orphaned resources remain
- ✅ Process manager integration is correct

### Duplicate Service Support
- ✅ Multiple instances of same MCP type can be created
- ✅ Each instance gets unique ports and credentials
- ✅ Instances run independently without interference
- ✅ Database constraints allow multiple instances per user/type
- ✅ Proper instance numbering and limits
