# Phase 1 Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the cleanup performed to align the `mcp-servers/` directory with Phase 1 architecture requirements.

## Files Removed

### ❌ Universal/Shared Infrastructure (Not Needed)
- `universal-mcp-server.js` - Each service has its own index.js entry point
- `config/service-registry.js` - No auto-discovery, manual service management

### ❌ Shared Routes and Handlers (Not Needed)
- `routes/mcp-routes.js` - Each service handles its own routing
- `handlers/endpoint-handlers.js` - Each service has its own endpoint handlers
- `handlers/resource-handlers.js` - Each service has its own resource handlers  
- `handlers/tool-handlers.js` - Each service has its own tool handlers

### ❌ Templates (Not Needed)
- `templates/graphql.js` - Not using shared templates
- `templates/rest-api.js` - Not using shared templates
- `templates/routes.js` - Not using shared templates

### ❌ Shared Utils (Not Needed)
- `utils/server-setup.js` - Each service sets up its own server

## Services Restructured

The following services were restructured to match Phase 1 architecture:

### Before (Old Structure)
```
services/
├── figma/
│   ├── config.js         # ❌ Removed - config now in index.js
│   ├── handlers/         # ✅ Renamed to endpoints/
│   └── routes.js         # ❌ Removed - routing in endpoints/
```

### After (Phase 1 Structure)
```
figma/
├── index.js              # ✅ New - Entry point with built-in config
├── endpoints/            # ✅ Renamed from handlers/
│   ├── endpoint-handlers.js
│   ├── jsonrpc-handler.js
│   ├── resource-handlers.js
│   └── tool-handlers.js
├── api/                  # ✅ New - Service-specific API logic
└── utils/                # ✅ New - Service-specific utilities
```

## Services Updated
- **figma** - Restructured to Phase 1 format
- **github** - Restructured to Phase 1 format  
- **slack** - Restructured to Phase 1 format
- **notion** - Restructured to Phase 1 format
- **discord** - Restructured to Phase 1 format

## Changes Made Per Service

### 1. Removed Files
- `config.js` - Configuration now built into index.js
- `routes.js` - Routing handled by endpoints

### 2. Renamed Directories
- `handlers/` → `endpoints/` - Better reflects MCP protocol endpoints

### 3. Created New Directories
- `api/` - For service-specific business logic
- `utils/` - For service-specific utilities

### 4. Created Entry Points
- `index.js` - New entry point with:
  - Built-in service configuration
  - TODO comments for Phase 1 implementation
  - Express server setup placeholder
  - Endpoint loading placeholder

## Phase 1 Architecture Benefits

### ✅ What We Achieved
- **Independent Services**: Each service is completely self-contained
- **No Shared Dependencies**: No universal server or shared utilities
- **Consistent Structure**: All services follow the same pattern
- **Clear Entry Points**: Each service has its own index.js
- **Built-in Configuration**: No external config files needed

### ✅ Alignment with Documentation
This structure now perfectly matches the Phase 1 documentation:

```
backend/src/mcp-servers/
├── figma/
│   ├── index.js          # Entry point with built-in config
│   ├── endpoints/        # MCP protocol endpoints
│   ├── api/              # Service-specific API logic
│   └── utils/            # Helper functions
├── github/
│   ├── index.js          # Entry point with built-in config
│   ├── endpoints/        # MCP protocol endpoints
│   ├── api/              # Service-specific API logic
│   └── utils/            # Helper functions
└── [other services following same pattern]
```

## Next Steps

### For Each Service
1. **Update index.js** with correct port and auth type from mcp-ports config
2. **Implement Express server** setup and endpoint loading
3. **Create API integrations** in the api/ folder
4. **Add utility functions** in the utils/ folder
5. **Update startup script** to include the service

### For System
1. **Create startup script** that lists all services
2. **Test individual service startup** with `node index.js`
3. **Test PM2 batch startup** with startup script
4. **Verify health endpoints** work for all services

## File Count Summary

**Removed**: 9 files (universal infrastructure + shared utilities)
**Restructured**: 5 services (figma, github, slack, notion, discord)
**Created**: 15 new files (5 index.js + 10 new directories)

The codebase is now clean, consistent, and ready for Phase 1 implementation!
