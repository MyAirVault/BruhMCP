# Documentation Index

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for the multi-tenant MCP service architecture and implementation.

## Core Documentation

### [phase1.md](./phase1.md)
**Multi-Tenant MCP Service Management and Startup Flow**
- Updated Phase 1 implementation with multi-tenant architecture
- Service structure with instance-based routing
- Multi-user isolation and authentication
- Database-driven credential management
- Step-by-step implementation process for multi-tenant services

### [database-redesign-flow.md](./database-redesign-flow.md)
**Database Redesign Flow: Static Service Architecture**
- Complete database schema for multi-tenant MCP services
- User instance management and credential storage
- Authentication flow design (API key and OAuth)
- URL structure and nginx routing architecture
- Service registry and instance lifecycle management

### [multi-tenant-mcp-flow.md](./multi-tenant-mcp-flow.md)
**Multi-Tenant MCP Service Flow Documentation**
- Detailed request flow from client to service response
- Instance-based authentication middleware
- Database credential lookup and validation
- Complete user isolation examples
- Error handling and security considerations

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed
- **Figma MCP Service**: Full multi-tenant implementation with instance-based routing
- **Database Integration**: Instance credential lookup and validation
- **Authentication Middleware**: Instance-based authentication with usage tracking
- **Multi-User Support**: Complete isolation between users of the same service

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Database schema deployment
- Nginx configuration updates
- Frontend instance creation flow
- Service registry population

### ðŸ“‹ Planned
- Additional MCP services (GitHub, Slack, etc.)
- OAuth authentication implementation
- Advanced monitoring and analytics
- Service health monitoring dashboard

## Quick Start

1. **Read Phase 1 Documentation**: Start with [phase1.md](./phase1.md) for architecture overview
2. **Understand Database Design**: Review [database-redesign-flow.md](./database-redesign-flow.md) for data structure
3. **Follow Request Flow**: Study [multi-tenant-mcp-flow.md](./multi-tenant-mcp-flow.md) for complete request lifecycle

## Architecture Benefits

- **Service Independence**: Services start without database dependencies
- **Complete User Isolation**: Each user's credentials and data completely separated
- **Dynamic Scalability**: One service handles unlimited users through instance routing
- **Security & Compliance**: Instance-level credential management and expiration
- **Operational Simplicity**: Standard HTTP/REST architecture with nginx routing

This architecture supports 300+ MCP services with complete multi-user isolation while maintaining operational simplicity and security.
