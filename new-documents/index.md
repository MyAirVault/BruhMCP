## Quick Start

### For Architecture Understanding
1. **Read Phase 1 Documentation**: Start with [phase1.md](./phase1.md) for architecture overview
2. **Understand Database Design**: Review [database-redesign-flow.md](./database-redesign-flow.md) for data structure
3. **Follow Request Flow**: Study [multi-tenant-mcp-flow.md](./multi-tenant-mcp-flow.md) for complete request lifecycle

### For MCP Development
1. **Read Protocol Specification**: Start with [mcp-protocol-specification.md](./mcp-protocol-specification.md) for official requirements
2. **Follow Development Guide**: Use [mcp-server-development-guide.md](./mcp-server-development-guide.md) for implementation
3. **Reference Troubleshooting**: Keep [mcp-troubleshooting-guide.md](./mcp-troubleshooting-guide.md) handy for issues

## Architecture Benefits

- **Service Independence**: Services start without database dependencies
- **Complete User Isolation**: Each user's credentials and data completely separated
- **Dynamic Scalability**: One service handles unlimited users through instance routing
- **Security & Compliance**: Instance-level credential management and expiration
- **Operational Simplicity**: Standard HTTP/REST architecture with nginx routing

This architecture supports 300+ MCP services with complete multi-user isolation while maintaining operational simplicity and security.
